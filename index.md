Welcome! I’m an MIT sophomore studying Electrical Engineering & Computer Science and Mathematics. I focus on programming languages and computer architecture, with interests in performance engineering, compiler optimization, machine learning, numerical methods, and finance.


Outside of school I enjoy language learning, radio, music, environmental sustainability, and time in nature.
