# Gordon Lichtstein

## Introduction
Hi everybody, I'm Gordon!


I'm an incoming sophomore at MIT studying Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, and Mathematics,with a focus on programming languages and computer architecture. I'm especially interested in the intersection of performance engineering, compiler optimization, machine learning, numerical methods, and finance.

Outside of school Iâ€™m passionate about language learning, radio, music, environmental sustainability, and nature.
